# About me

I got access to computer at a pretty early age, probably that's why I'm fond of working with computer. Basically, I'm interested in everything that is computer related.

When I was 16, I got accepted in a High School which is specialized in teaching Competitive Programming (basically is just solving problems with algorithms). I met many people with the same hobby with me, which make the love with computer in me grew even more.
